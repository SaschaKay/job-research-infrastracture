## 🐳 Project Containers Overview

| Container       | Purpose                                                       | Ports                  | 
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `jupyter`       | Jupyter Lab environment for development and experimentation   | 8888, 8889, 5000       | 
| `postgres`      | PostgreSQL database instance for metadata and storage         | 5432                   |
| `pgadmin`       | Web UI for managing PostgreSQL                                | 5055 (mapped to port 80) | 

## 🗂️ Docker Volumes

Data in these named volumes persists between container restarts.

| Volume Name           | Used By           | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `postgres_data`       | `postgres`        | Stores PostgreSQL database files (`/var/lib/postgresql/data`)          |
| `pgadmin_data`        | `pgadmin`         | Stores pgAdmin configuration and session data (`/var/lib/pgadmin`)     |
| `jupyter_data`        | `jupyter`         | Stores Jupyter notebooks and outputs (`/home/jovyan/work`)             |


## 🌐 Exposed Ports

Ports mapped from containers to the host system to enable access to web interfaces and services.

| Host Port | Container     | Internal Port | Description                             |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `8888`    | `jupyter`     | `8888`        | JupyterLab main interface               |
| `8889`    | `jupyter`     | `8889`        | Second Jupyter instance port            |
| `5000`    | `jupyter`     | `5000`        | Custom dev port (e.g., Flask app)       |
| `5432`    | `postgres`    | `5432`        | PostgreSQL access                       |
| `5055`    | `pgadmin`     | `80`          | pgAdmin web UI                          |

### Accessing Container Ports via SSH Tunnels

Some IDEs create tunnels automatically. If you use VS Code with the Remote - SSH extension, it will notify you about available ports after you run `docker compose up`.
Sometimes, after automatic reconnection through VS Code, you won't be able to reach ports anymore. In this case, reload VS Code window manually or restart VS Code.

If you need to create a tunnel by hand, run

```bash
ssh -N -L LOCAL_PORT:localhost:HOST_PORT your_user@your_vm_ip
```

Where LOCAL_PORT you choose by yourself (usually the same as HOST_PORT).
After running the command, open <http://localhost:LOCAL_PORT> in your browser.



> 📝 VS Code automatically assigns new ports for each new process. To see running notebooks and their port numbers, use:
> ```bash
> docker exec -it <jupyter_container_name> jupyter notebook list # shows the running notebooks and their port numbers
> ```
> You can stop a particular notebook using its port number:
> ```bash
> jupyter notebook stop 8889
> ```
                          
> 📝 If you need to kill a process that is using a particular port on your local machine, run:
> ```bash
> lsof -n -i4TCP:[PORT] # shows PID.
> kill -9 [PID] # kill the process.
> ```
